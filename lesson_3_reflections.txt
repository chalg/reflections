When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want a remote repository to collaborate with other people, as it is not likely that everyone will be using your computer to make their changes.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may be working on a piece of functionality that other people are working on, however you are not comfortable pulling in other changes to the local repository, in case it changes something.
